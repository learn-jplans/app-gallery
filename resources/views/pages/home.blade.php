					<h4>Invoker</h4>
					<p>
						Invoker is a ranged intelligence Hero who is very 
						difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses 
						a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of 
						them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is 
						his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he 
						learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, 
						which serve as the basic ingredients or components for 
						him to create a new ability using his ultimate. 
						Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can 
						invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his 
						invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, 
						from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even 
						saving himself from danger. His three reagents can be 
						upgraded up to level 7 which determines the power and 
						potency of his invoked abilities, making it more 
						powerful than an ordinary spell. Because of this, he 
						can be played in almost any role possible. Invoker can 
						be a carry, semi-carry, ganker, pusher, initiator or even 
						support. He is also the only hero who doesn't have Attribute Bonuses, thus he has average attributes. However, his three reagents provide passive attributes with each level, and each instance of his reagents provides a passive bonus, allowing for specialization at early levels and situational boosts at later levels. His extremely flexible nature allows him to use many different combinations of items effectively but also make him dependent on solid builds and a good gold advantage.
